//! Ordered reasoning, text, and tool-call parsing through one state machine.
//!
//! Qwen3 is gated behind
//! [`DYN_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_PARSERS_V2`](dynamo_runtime::config::environment_names::llm::DYN_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_PARSERS_V2).
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! Dynamo serves a Qwen3 turn today by chaining two independent parsers: the reasoning
//! parser strips `<think>...</think>` across the whole stream into one assembled
//! `reasoning_content`, and the tool-call jail then scans whatever is left. That chain
//! cannot represent WHERE a thought happened. Given
//!
//! ```text
//! <think>Look it up.</think><tool_call>…</tool_call><think>Now answer.</think>It's 18C.
//! ```
//!
//! it serves `reasoning("Look it up.Now answer.")`, then the call, then `text("It's 18C.")`:
//! the second thought moved ahead of the call it followed and fused with the first. A
//! client rendering thoughts inline puts them in the wrong place, and a client counting
//! reasoning turns sees one where there were two.
//!
//! Ordering is not a field the split can add — it is lost at the seam between the two
//! parsers. So when this path is enabled, ONE [`UnifiedParser`] owns the whole grammar
//! and emits deltas in the order the model produced them, and this module maps those
//! deltas onto the OpenAI streaming/batch wire shapes.
//!
//! # Why one chunk per delta
//!
//! [`ChatCompletionStreamResponseDelta`] carries `content`, `reasoning_content` and
//! `tool_calls` side by side with no way to say which came first. Packing a whole
//! `push` into one delta object would throw away exactly the ordering this path exists
//! to preserve, so every [`UnifiedParserEvent`] becomes its own chunk.
